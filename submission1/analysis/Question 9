Why do so many plans charge a $0 premium? What does that really mean to a beneficiary?

Since Medicare recipients receive Part A at no cost to them, a $0 premium for MA means that the beneficiaries do not have to pay an extra monthly premium for what part A already covers in the MA plan. Instead, to receive part B coverage they would still have to pay the part B standard premium.
